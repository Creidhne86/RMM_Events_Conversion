     This course is designed to introduce you to the 3d design process using Solidworks CAD software, a powerful 3D modeling tool used in a variety of industries. The course will cover the basics of Solidworks, including the user interface, basic features, and tools needed to create 3D models.

     The main focus of the class will be on learning the fundamentals Solidworks. You will learn how to navigate the interface and tools, create sketches, and use basic features to create 3D models. You will also learn how to use Solidworks’ parametric modeling capabilities to quickly make changes to your designs.

    Before you leave the class, you will export your 3D model to an STL file, a common file format used for 3D printing. We will kick off a 3D print of your part, and all parts will be available for pickup within one week of the class. You will have the opportunity to see your design come to life and take it home with you.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Whether you're interested in creating prototypes, product designs, or just want to learn a new skill, this course is an excellent starting point for anyone interested in 3D modeling and Solidworks CAD.

     As far as knives are concerned, the harder the steel, the better the edge, however, the harder edge makes for a brittle knife. A balance is needed between the soft flexible metal and the hard brittle metal to achieve a knife that will hold an edge without breaking. In this class more techniques for blade smithing will be covered, including various heat treatments, tapering, and tempering methods used to maximize strength with durability.

The “Baron” fountain pen is trimmed with nibs, clips and other elements made out of the highest quality silver plating which gives each pen a distinguished look in addition to durability.

   The fountain pen features an ultra-smooth threading removable cap that screws on to both the bottom and top of the pen. The Baron Fountain Pen not only is a great looking pen, but it is also light weight and one of the smoothest writing instruments available for everyday use and has a two-tone German made nib with an iridium tip. The artistic fittings are hand worked and polished and the solid metal external components add to the pens expensive and hardy feel.

   Damascus, Forge Welding Dissimilar Steels (high work level)
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face=""Ubuntu"" style=""font-size: 16px;"">
   Details: For centuries different methods were utilized to produce metal that was both hard and flexible. Pattern welded steel was the solution that met those requirements. It was the alternating layers of hard and soft steels that produced superior steel in a time before refinement was widely practiced. Students in this class will utilize their skills to produce their own piece of the pattern welded steel known as Damascus. This class will introduce students to the process of forge welding, acid etching, and several techniques to obtain different patterns within the steel. It is suggested that a previous courses should be taken prior to this one as the techniques are strenuous and require a lot of stamina. However if you are up to the challenge, you are more than welcome to begin at this level.

  Arrangements and Alignment (Light work level)
 </p>
 <p>
  Details - Precision is very important when working any project that requires many pieces that need to be repeated then fitted together. This is especially the case when a project needs to fall within a set parameter. This class will cover the methods of cutting glass and how to properly measure, arrange, and adjust each piece to create a 3-D sculpture using stained glass! This method of creating 3-D objects out of stained glass is a relatively new innovation arising in the 19 century when the copper foil method first came about.
 </p>
 <p>
  Work Involved - (cutting, measuring, copper foiling, soldering, grinding edges)
 </p>
 <p>
  Tools &amp; Materials - (Stained Glass of various shades and colors, glass cutters, scribes, oil, soldering irons, flush cut pliers, splitting pliers, nibbling pliers, tracing sheets, clear glass practice sheets, copper foil, diamond files/grinder, plastic water color brushes, small plastic paint cups, paper towels, flux, patinas, 60/40 lead solder)
 </p>
 <p>
  There will be a one-hour lunch break.
 </p>
 <p>
  There will be no refunds within 14 days of the event.
