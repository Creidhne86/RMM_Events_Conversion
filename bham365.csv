   </span>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <span style="""">
    <font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">
     In the first half of the class, you will learn the fundamentals of Solidworks. You will learn how to navigate the interface and tools, create sketches, and use basic features to create 3D models. You will also learn how to use Solidworks’ parametric modeling capabilities to quickly make changes to your designs.

    Before you leave the class, you will export your 3D model to an STL file, a common file format used for 3D printing. We will kick off a 3D print of your part, and all parts will be available for pickup within one week of the class. You will have the opportunity to see your design come to life and take it home with you.

 </p>
 <p>
  Advanced weld project class, Friday May 19th 3hr course with extra open hour time available as needed. Additional material charge will apply (for the actual material cost) if you select a project larger than a stool.
 </p>
 <p>
  This class requires prior welding training (Intro to MIG, TIG, or stick class, or sufficient other welding experience to produce sound welds) as all the class time will be needed for fabrication without extra time available for welding training.
 </p>
 <p>
  Under the guidance of a fabrication instructor, using welding, cutting, and bending techniques you’ll make cool stuff out of metal!
 </p>
 <p>
  We’ll have several designs to choose from; Intricate tables and stools, etc. but you’re welcome to build your own unique design.
 </p>
 <p>
  What to wear: At RMM, you must dress safely and appropriately. Arrive for class in all-natural fiber clothing (100% cotton), long pants, and closed-toe, closed-heel shoes with socks that protect up to the ankle. Long hair must be tied back. Nylon, polyester, spandex, or other synthetics are not allowed around machines, equipment, or processes that can produce hot fragments, sparks, or flames. Additional protective gear will be provided as needed.

  About the Instructor: Stephen Charles is a former Welding Engineer with many years of experience in production welding and custom fabrication. He has taught hundreds of beginners in the basics of welding and fabrication. Also, he’s pretty funny, so if you don’t have a sense of humor just smile and nod when everyone else laughs and maybe no one will notice.

   TIG welding is most commonly used to weld thin sections of stainless steel and non-ferrous metals such as aluminum, magnesium, and copper alloys. The process grants the operator greater control over the weld than competing processes such as MIG welding, allowing for stronger, higher quality welds.

  <font style=""font-size: 16px;"">
   Students will have the opportunity to learn the basic techniques of the TIG process and practice with feedback from an expert.

   In this class students will learn how to take one metal object and transform it into another in a case of extreme transformation. Students will take old hammers consisting of tool steel and transform the striking surface into an axe. Students will also be introduced to drifting dies designed to widen the eye for proper fitting to an axe handle. From here students will learn how to shape and refine the blade using the grinder and finally finishing it off with a fair amount of sanding before polishing. The final task is the heat treatment to temper the blade to withstand heavy blows. This will involve normalization, oil quenching, and heat tempering.

 <p>
  Under the guidance of a fabrication instructor, using welding, cutting, and bending techniques you’ll
 </p>
 <p>
  make cool stuff out of metal!
 </p>
 <p>
  We’ll have a few simple designs to choose from (chain hearts, metal letters/words, pencil holders, small
 </p>
 <p>
  table/shelf, etc.) but you’re encouraged to peruse our diverse collection of reclaimed scrap metal to
 </p>
 <p>
  devise your own unique design.
 </p>
 <p>
  Prior welding experience is great; however, we will review basic MIG welding techniques, metal cutting,
 </p>
 <p>
  grinding, as well as the basics of hand tool use and shop safety.
 </p>
 <p>
  What to wear: At RMM, you must dress safely and appropriately. Arrive for class in all-natural fiber.
 </p>
 <p>
  clothing (100% cotton), long pants, and closed-toe, closed-heel shoes with socks that protect up to the

 <p>
  production welding and custom fabrication. He has taught hundreds of beginners in the basics of
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  nod when everyone else laughs and maybe no one will notice.

    Announcing Teardown Tuesdays! This is a hands-on class to take things apart and find out what makes them tick. In this first session we will disassemble one (or more) flat screen TV’s. We will figure out what the different parts are, how to identify (and in some cases test) parts, find ways to repurpose some of them, and if we’re lucky, we may be able to find out why the TV died. We’ll also talk about safety and the proper use of test equipment.  The class will be led by an expert in the field of Electronics.

    About the Instructor:
   </strong>
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  Mark Sillay will be the guest demonstrator for the Saturday April 8Alabama Woodturning Association’s meeting, 9:00 a.m. at Hardware Park. In the afternoon class, Mark will demonstrate his technique of wood slicing, a technique which keeps him from ever having to use sandpaper to get a smooth finish. He will demonstrate the five basic cuts using this technique.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mark Sillay began woodworking when he was six years old. His father gave him a set of hand tools, an old packing box with a vise mounted on it for a workbench and scrap wood. Then his father, with patience and loving instruction, continued to guide him throughout his youthful years, From that, he grew to appreciate tool skills, freedom of design and superior quality finish work. Mark started woodturning in the 9th grade.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mr. Sillay attributes his love for woodturning to Cindy Drozda, who helped him transform his woodturning life into a joyful journey. Having made many basic bowls,Mark has turned his focus to creating finer turned objects.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mr. Sillay finds satisfaction in both the creative process and in overcoming the challenges to complete fine quality finished work. He specializes in using a razorsharp spindle gouge and watching the shapes evolve while he is creating intricate turnings.
 </p>
 <p>
  He is a member of West Georgia Woodturners and the American Association of Woodturners. He travels all over the United States giving demos and has numerous You Tube videos on woodturning. Mark is also going to be bringing exotic woods, in case someone would like to purchase wood like Norfolk Island Pine, etc.

    In this class students will forge a small knife out of a piece of solid stock metal. This lesson will cover material foresight, design vs functionality, and will briefly hit upon types of metal and tempering techniques. The task used to create this knife will involve drawing- stretching out metal in a linear direction, forging out a bevel using hammer control, cutting, and sharpening. This class will involve the challenge of utilizing tongs and will introduce the methods necessary to handle the metal quickly and efficiently. Though this is an intermediate class, no previous knowledge is necessary to take this class. Work level is light to moderate.
