   <br/>
   <span style="""">
    <font face=""Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">
     In the first half of the class, you will learn the fundamentals of Solidworks. You will learn how to navigate the interface and tools, create sketches, and use basic features to create 3D models. You will also learn how to use Solidworks’ parametric modeling capabilities to quickly make changes to your designs.

 </p>
 <p>
  Advanced weld project class, Friday May 19th 3hr course with extra open hour time available as needed. Additional material charge will apply (for the actual material cost) if you select a project larger than a stool.
 </p>
 <p>
  This class requires prior welding training (Intro to MIG, TIG, or stick class, or sufficient other welding experience to produce sound welds) as all the class time will be needed for fabrication without extra time available for welding training.
 </p>
 <p>
  Under the guidance of a fabrication instructor, using welding, cutting, and bending techniques you’ll make cool stuff out of metal!
 </p>
 <p>
  We’ll have several designs to choose from; Intricate tables and stools, etc. but you’re welcome to build your own unique design.
 </p>
 <p>
  What to wear: At RMM, you must dress safely and appropriately. Arrive for class in all-natural fiber clothing (100% cotton), long pants, and closed-toe, closed-heel shoes with socks that protect up to the ankle. Long hair must be tied back. Nylon, polyester, spandex, or other synthetics are not allowed around machines, equipment, or processes that can produce hot fragments, sparks, or flames. Additional protective gear will be provided as needed.

  About the Instructor: Stephen Charles is a former Welding Engineer with many years of experience in production welding and custom fabrication. He has taught hundreds of beginners in the basics of welding and fabrication. Also, he’s pretty funny, so if you don’t have a sense of humor just smile and nod when everyone else laughs and maybe no one will notice.

   TIG welding is most commonly used to weld thin sections of stainless steel and non-ferrous metals such as aluminum, magnesium, and copper alloys. The process grants the operator greater control over the weld than competing processes such as MIG welding, allowing for stronger, higher quality welds.

   Students will have the opportunity to learn the basic techniques of the TIG process and practice with feedback from an expert.
