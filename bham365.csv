     In the first half of the class, you will learn the fundamentals of Solidworks. You will learn how to navigate the interface and tools, create sketches, and use basic features to create 3D models. You will also learn how to use Solidworks’ parametric modeling capabilities to quickly make changes to your designs.

     The second half of the class will focus on creating your own personal project. You will have the opportunity to use your new skills to design and create your own 3D model. Some example projects include a phone stand, desk organizer, or replacement parts for items around your home. Feel free to bring your own project!

    Before you leave the class, you will export your 3D model to an STL file, a common file format used for 3D printing. We will kick off a 3D print of your part, and all parts will be available for pickup within one week of the class. You will have the opportunity to see your design come to life and take it home with you.

    Whether you're interested in creating prototypes, product designs, or just want to learn a new skill, this course is an excellent starting point for anyone interested in 3D modeling and Solidworks CAD.
