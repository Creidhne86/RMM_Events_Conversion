 s course is designed to introduce you to the 3d design process using Solid
 works CAD software\, a powerful 3D modeling tool used in a variety of indu
 stries. The course will cover the basics of Solidworks\, including the use
 r interface\, basic features\, and tools needed to create 3D models.\n

  be on learning the fundamentals Solidworks. You will learn how to navigat
 e the interface and tools\, create sketches\, and use basic features to cr
 eate 3D models. You will also learn how to use Solidworks’ parametric mo
 deling capabilities to quickly make changes to your designs.\n    </font>\

 all parts will be available for pickup within one week of the class. You w
 ill have the opportunity to see your design come to life and take it home 
 with you.\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    Whether you're interested in creating
  prototypes\, product designs\, or just want to learn a new skill\, this c
