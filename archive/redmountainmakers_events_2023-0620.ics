 s course is designed to introduce you to the 3d design process using Solid
 works CAD software\, a powerful 3D modeling tool used in a variety of indu
 stries. The course will cover the basics of Solidworks\, including the use
 r interface\, basic features\, and tools needed to create 3D models.\n    
 </font>\n   </span>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <span style="">\n    <font fac
 e="Arial\, Helvetica\, sans-serif">\n     In the first half of the class\,
  you will learn the fundamentals of Solidworks. You will learn how to navi
 gate the interface and tools\, create sketches\, and use basic features to
  create 3D models. You will also learn how to use Solidworks’ parametric
  modeling capabilities to quickly make changes to your designs.\n    </fon

 ial\, Helvetica\, sans-serif">\n     The second half of the class will foc
 us on creating your own personal project. You will have the opportunity to
  use your new skills to design and create your own 3D model. Some example 
 projects include a phone stand\, desk organizer\, or replacement parts for
  items around your home. Feel free to bring your own project!\n    </font>

  you leave the class\, you will export your 3D model to an STL file\, a co
 mmon file format used for 3D printing. We will kick off a 3D print of your
  part\, and all parts will be available for pickup within one week of the 
 class. You will have the opportunity to see your design come to life and t
 ake it home with you.\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    Whether you're interested
  in creating prototypes\, product designs\, or just want to learn a new sk

 3D modeling and Solidworks CAD.\n   </font>\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p style="
