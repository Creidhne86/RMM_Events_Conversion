 s course is designed to introduce you to the 3d design process using Solid
 works CAD software\, a powerful 3D modeling tool used in a variety of indu
 stries. The course will cover the basics of Solidworks\, including the use
 r interface\, basic features\, and tools needed to create 3D models.\n    
 </font>\n   </span>\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   <span style="">\n    <font fac

  you will learn the fundamentals of Solidworks. You will learn how to navi
 gate the interface and tools\, create sketches\, and use basic features to
  create 3D models. You will also learn how to use Solidworks’ parametric
  modeling capabilities to quickly make changes to your designs.\n    </fon

 us on creating your own personal project. You will have the opportunity to
  use your new skills to design and create your own 3D model. Some example 
 projects include a phone stand\, desk organizer\, or replacement parts for
  items around your home. Feel free to bring your own project!\n    </font>

  you leave the class\, you will export your 3D model to an STL file\, a co
 mmon file format used for 3D printing. We will kick off a 3D print of your
  part\, and all parts will be available for pickup within one week of the 
 class. You will have the opportunity to see your design come to life and t
 ake it home with you.\n    <br/>\n    <br/>\n    Whether you're interested

 to produce metal that was both hard and flexible. Pattern welded steel was
  the solution that met those requirements. It was the alternating layers o
 f hard and soft steels that produced superior steel in a time before refin
 ement was widely practiced. Students in this class will utilize their skil
 ls to produce their own piece of the pattern welded steel known as Damascu
 s. This class will introduce students to the process of forge welding\, ac
 id etching\, and several techniques to obtain different patterns within th
 e steel. It is suggested that a previous courses should be taken prior to 
 this one as the techniques are strenuous and require a lot of stamina. How
 ever if you are up to the challenge\, you are more than welcome to begin a
 t this level.\n  </font>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <font face="Ubuntu" style="font-s

 n    <font style="font-size: 16px\;">\n     <font>\n      Students will ut
 ilize a high carbon railroad spike and learn methods that induce carbon in
 to the metal while also learning how to temper in a process called normali
 zation. The metal will then posses both features of a durable and hard met
 al that is ideal for knives.\n     </font>\n     <br/>\n    </font>\n   </

 "">\n    <font style="font-size: 16px\;">\n     As far as knives are conce
 rned\, the harder the steel\, the better the edge\, however\, the harder e
 dge makes for a brittle knife. A balance is needed between the soft flexib
 le metal and the hard brittle metal to achieve a knife that will hold an e
 dge without breaking. In this class more techniques for blade smithing wil
 l be covered\, including various heat treatments\, tapering\, and temperin
 g methods used to maximize strength with durability.\n    </font>\n   </sp
